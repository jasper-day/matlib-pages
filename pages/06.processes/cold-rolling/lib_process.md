title: 'cold rolling'
---

Cold rolling is a form of metal working where the material is rolled at a cold temperature. It induces work hardening, resulting in pieces with internal stresses. These internal stresses make the piece harder to machine (and likely to bend if machined asymmetrically), but they give it a greater yield strength.
