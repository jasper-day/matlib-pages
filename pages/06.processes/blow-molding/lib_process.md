title: 'Blow Molding'
---

Blow molding is a process which is used to form polymer-type materials. The material is heated beyond its glass transition temperature, and then air is blown into the center of the item to push it against the walls of the mold. The result is a hollow molded item. Blow molding is similar to [centrifugal die casting](/processes/centrifugal-die-casting), but because the material is heated to a viscous (not liquid) state, it is not necessary to rotate the mold to force the substrate to the edges of the mold.

Traditionally, blow molding was used to create glassware.
