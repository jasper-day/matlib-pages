title: Working with MatWeb

[**MatWeb**](https://matweb.com/) (not to be confused with MatLib!) is a third-party database of *material properties*. They have the properties of just about every material under the sun, collected from publicly-available manufacturer's datasheets. MatWeb is a useful and extensive resource, but the sheer number of items available (and the clunkiness of the interface) often make it difficult to find exactly what you're looking for.

MatLib uses MatWeb for its material classifications and properties. This allows us to avoid some repeated work, and provide a slightly better interface to the most common and useful pages of MatWeb without going through their web interface. What follows is a quick description of how to find a particular material on MatWeb, at different levels of granularity.
