This item takes a common metal, Aluminum 6061, and makes it uncommon. Aluminum 6061 is a lightweight alloy of aluminum which is in common use whenever a cheap or lightweight material is needed; it's easy to extrude and to machine. What's not so common is the structure of this material, which is an open-cell foam.

Duocel is an American company that makes aerospace foams out of a variety of materials. Look closely at their foams and you'll see *ligaments* and *cells*: the ligaments, or small spidery lines of material, connect together into cell-like structures. It's an *open-cell* foam: there's no air trapped inside the material; you could blow right through it. Compare to the [closed-cell aluminum coal](items/cc-al-foam), which traps air like bubble wrap.

Lightweight foams like these are much more expensive than solid blocks of material. They require specialized equipment to make, and not many companies produce them. The main applications are in aerospace, where lightweight but strong structures are required.
