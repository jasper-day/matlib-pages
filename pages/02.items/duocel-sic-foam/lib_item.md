Silicon carbide, much like [aluminum oxide](items/3M-fre-cut), is a hard
material. They even have similar common names: Silicon carbide is called
"carborundum", and aluminum oxide is "corundum"! Silicon carbide is used in
applications where extremely hard, durable ceramics are required, like brake pads and bulletproof armor.

This sample of foamed silicon carbide retains the immense hardness of the ceramic, but since most of the structure is air, it is also quite lightweight. 
Look closely at the structure of the foam, and you will see that the structure is made up of spidery spindles connected together. Unlike the [closed-cell aluminum foam](items/cc-al-foam), this foam is "open cell". Closed-cell foams are like bubble wrap; this foam is more like candy floss.
