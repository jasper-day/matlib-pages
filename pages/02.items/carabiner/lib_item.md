Carabiners ("crabs" or "biners") provide a quick and convenient way to connect ropes together.

The collection of carabiners at different stages of completion show off the
manufacture process. First a raw bar of steel is bent roughly into shape; then
the ends are punched square. Next the bar is heated to a high temperature, and
is stamped into the shape of the carabiner (picture two). The stamping process
results in squeeze-out or "flash" which is visible in the picture.
