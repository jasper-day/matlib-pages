This is a *tensile test specimen*, a standardized item often used in engineering to determine the properties of a material. The specimen is placed in a machine that pulls on both ends, while measuring how much it stretches. This particular item has been stretched enough to break it.

Although tensile testing in this manner is the foundation of many engineering material analyses, there are some caveats. Depending on how quickly the specimen is stretched, it might behave differently. The [science putty](science_putty) is a great example of this: when pulled slowly, it can stretch extremely far, but when it's pulled quickly it snaps. Tensile testing machines don't give any indication of this behavior.
