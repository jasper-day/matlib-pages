Copper piping was commonly used for residential piping, but is being phased out due to its high cost. 

Copper readily "work hardens": As it's pulled and drawn, it becomes more and more difficult to work with, a process that can only be reset by slow heating[^1]. This work hardening occurs at the factory, as the copper pipes are drawn through dies. If you bought work-hardened copper piping, you would not be able to bend it around curves, so for applications where bending is necessary, manufacturers sell "soft" copper piping. It's the same as "rigid" copper piping, but it's been annealed to remove the work hardening.

This section of copper pipe froze one winter, bursting some sections and allowing other sections to corrode heavily.

[^1]: This process is known as "annealing". Work hardening creates stresses inside the part, as the microstructure moves around to accommodate the deformation. Annealing allows the microstructure to return to a non-stressed state
