Although this large block appears and feels solid to the touch, it's actually mostly air. This is a closed-cell metal foam made of aluminum. It's like a large piece of bubble wrap, but made of metal instead of poppable plastic.

Metal foams have uses anywhere something strong but lightweight is required, like in aerospace applications.
