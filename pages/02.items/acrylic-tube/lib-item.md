Look closely: this small tube of plastic is transparent, making it difficult to see. Polymethylmethacrylate, (PMMA or acrylic) is a polymer that is often desired for its high degree of optical clearness. This acrylic tube is very similar to those that were used for the marble tracks in the [Marble Machine X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uid4N1EbXRY).
