From [the manufacturer](https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/p/d/b40064968/):

> We gave these discs premium, micron-graded aluminum oxide abrasive, which is bonded to a durable polyester film backing to produce a fast cut-rate and uniform finish on wood, solid surface composites, plastic, fiberglass, paint prep, coating and corrosion removal, primer, e-coat, metal, or where loading is an issue. An anti-load coating and open coat surface increase efficiency and product life by minimizing loading. The abrasive is resin-bonded and supports disc flexibility without sacrificing durability and reliable performance under high heat and pressure. To compliment the effective abrasive action, the polyester film backing flexes to help achieve a consistent finish over contours and offers greater tear-resistance than comparable paper products, making it ideal for high-production environments. And the pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA) provides easy attachment, holds the disc securely in place during use, and removes cleanly from the backup pad (sold separately). Designed for use with orbital and random orbital sanders, this disc comes in a range of micron grades and dust free option for complete multi-step sanding and finishing.

These discs are designed to attach to an orbital sander. The sander spins the disc around and vibrates it, allowing the user to achieve a sanded finish with far less effort than manually sanding would require.
