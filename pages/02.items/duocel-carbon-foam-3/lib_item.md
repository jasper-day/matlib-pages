This foam is made of a rare form of carbon known as "glassy carbon", which is made by heating polymers under a non-reactive environment. It combines many desirable properties: glassy carbon is hard, resists high temperatures, and conducts electricity. Since it's a foam, it has a high surface area and traps air. The low density and temperature resistance make it a good choice as a thermal insulator, and its conductivity and high surface area make it a good choice as an electrode for chemical applications.

**Reticulated**: *networked*, like the veins in a leaf

**Vitreous**: *glassy*

**Carbon**: *the main element present in this item*
