It's similar to the [fiber honeycomb sandwich](fiber_honeycomb_sandwich), but instead of being reinforced by fiber-impregnated polymers, this part is reinforced with aluminum sheets.

[Aluminum honeycomb](aluminum_honeycomb) inside the sandwich gives this part its immense structural rigidity, while also keeping it light: most of the internal space is air. Sandwiches like this are an extremely efficient way to use the material.

At its core, the honeycomb works for the same reason that an I-beam does. These items protect against bending by placing most of the material far away from the middle, and keeping the structure very light in between.
