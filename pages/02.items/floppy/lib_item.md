title: Floppy
---

This is a floppy drive, so-called because information is stored on a flexible magnetized disc.

Floppy drives were in common usage until the late '90s, until their replacement with other portable media storage.

When the drive is inserted into a computer, a small window is pushed aside, and the disc is exposed. A spindle inside the computer spins the floppy around.
